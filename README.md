`node version v18.10.0 (latest)`

### branch name conventions
- for new feature `${feature/fix}/{teamName}-{IssueNo}_{feature/issue Name}`
- example 1 for feature `feature/bears-20_layout`
- example 2 for bug fix `fix/bears-11_wireframe`

### code push and code merge
- commit new code to your working branch
- pull latest from dev branch
- if any conflict, resolve those and commit merge
- then push to your branch
- then create a pull request (PR) to dev branch from your working branch and add at-least one reviewer except you and notify her / him that you created a PR

## PR comments and commit massage should be little descriptive so the reviewer can understand.

# We should never update the main branch without a team meeting.
